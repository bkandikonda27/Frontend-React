In this project, you can boot up a website that contains a Search Bar, Stock Chart, and Stock Recommendation Components.

In this, Search Bar the user can search a company name or it's Stock Ticker. As the user inputs characters into the Search Bar component, an API call is made to pull a list of Company names and Company tickers based on the search input.

When the relevant company is selected within the drop down menu of the Search Bar, the user will see a the relevant Company's stock price over the last 100 days in a Line Graph and the company's analyst recommendations in a Bar graph that is split into (Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell, and Strong Sell).

The user needs a Finnhub API Key to pull the stock recommendations, but the existing AlphaVantage API key for getting Stock Price data works.
